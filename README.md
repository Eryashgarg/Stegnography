# Image Steganography Tool

This project is a Java-based GUI application for image steganography, developed using JavaFX and AWT. It allows users to embed data into images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method, ensuring minimal image distortion.

## Features

- **Data Embedding**: Embeds data into images with less than 1% image distortion using the LSB method.
- **Security**: Enhances security through hash-based storage of embedded data.
- **User Interface**: Utilizes JavaFX and AWT to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- **File Support**: Supports embedding data into images up to 1MB in size.

## Technologies Used

- Java
- JavaFX
- AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)
- Hashing Algorithms
- Encryption Techniques

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
- git clone https://github.com/Eryashgarg/Stegnography.git

2. **Compile and Run:**
